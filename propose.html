		<h2 class="heading-b-xxl">Topics of interest</h2>
		<p>
			XD Conf is a multi-disciplinary conference, with the goal of engaging ING people across all disciplines involved in experience design.
		</p>
		<p>
			Weâ€™re looking for talks on a broad range of topics, from <span class="line-serviceDesign">Service Design</span> and <span class="line-leanStartup">Lean Startup</span> to
			<span class="line-digitalExperiences">Digital Experiences</span>, and <span class="line-APIs">APIs &amp; DevOps</span>. These are not fixed categories and feel free to submit any talk that you think would be of interest to your ING colleagues. We will figure out where it belongs best on the schedule.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-b-xxl">Schedule</h2>
		<p>
			The conference is a two-day, single-track affair. We chose for this format as it helps in creating a shared experience for the audience to bond over.
		</p>
		<p>
			We offer different types of talks and of different lengths. The 45-minutes keynotes and the 25-minutes regular talks cater for more experienced presenters. The 7-minute lightning talks intend to invite for the less experienced presenter as well. A Master of Ceremony introduces each speaker and wraps up the keynotes and regular talks with a 5 minute Q&amp;A.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the morning of the second day we also have up to 5 workshops on offer. These 3-hour sessions are a great opportunity for you to give your audience hands-on experience with the topic you're so passionate about.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-b-xxl">Audience and speakers</h2>
		<p>
			The size of the audience is currently set at 200 people, with around 15 speakers providing for the talks and workshops.
		</p>
		<p>
			We aim for the majority of both the audience and the speakers to be ING employees. The conference is a showcase of actual and varied applications of experience design within ING. The presence of ING employees, on stage and in the audience, is therefore very much championed. We do welcome one or two well-regarded external speakers, and partners and other business relations may get invited too.
